### Installing fonts
At the moment I'm not going to be looking into the licensing of fonts, so you'll have to download them yourself.

1.  Download both [Roboto & Roboto Condensed](http://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Roboto|Roboto+Condensed) from Google Fonts.
    You don't need to select all fonts, just click on the download icon in the top right and choose the .zip file.
2.  Make sure they are correctly named, which they should be if you downloaded  from Google Fonts. The correct names can be found in `/1080i/Font.xml`.
3.  Place the files in `/fonts`.
